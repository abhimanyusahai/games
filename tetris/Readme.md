This folder contains C++ code for Tetris, built using SFML 2.4. While there have been several versions of Tetris over the decades, I have tried to stick as closely as possible to the classic version.

In order for the code to compile, please change "ResourcePath.mm" to return the path where you plan to store the resources (provided in the Resources folder).
